<h1><a href="https://dmzb.github.io/">David Zureick-Brown</a>'s letter of recommendation information</h1> 


Below is my checklist of things I ask for when I write a letter. (Some of these you may have already done, and some may not be appropriate for you; just do whichever make sense.)

<ul>
<li> Please try to let me know at least a <b>month in advance</b>. (I will still try to accomodate shorter deadlines, but the letter is likely to be better if I have more time.)


<li> A list of links to the <b>instructions/prompt</b> for the letter writer, with deadlines.
  <li> Instructions on <b>how to submit</b> (e.g., email to XXX, "you will receive an email", or send me a link, etc). 

  <li>Please also find out things like whether I need to mail a physical letter vs. upload to a web site, if my letter has a different deadline than the rest of your application, and any other special instructions.
  
<li> I have a <b>strong preference</b> for PDF or plain text documents.   A spreadsheet is also ok but I strongly prefer PDF or plain text.
  
<li>  Please <b> include your name</b> in the filename of any documents you send me.



<li> Who are your <b>other letter writers?</b> Include a sentence of context too (e.g., advised my honors thesis).

<li> Once you have <b>drafts</b> of anything you're submitting please send them to me.  The basic principle is that I can't write about something I don't know about.

  <li> If you are an undergraduate, I'd prefer you send an <b>unofficial copy of your transcript</b> too.

</ul>
  
<br> I leave it up to the applicant to make sure that I don't miss the deadline (something which has never happened so don't worry).  I ask that you send me frequent email (every week or more as the deadlines grow closer) to remind me.  I won't forget but this keeps it at the top of my to-do list.  At some point I will then send you an email back saying that I have mailed/uploaded/etc the letter. If you do not receive confirmation from me, then you should assume that I have not submitted your letter and you should pester me.

<BR>
<br> Finally, on the application page, please use the following for my personal information.

  <ul>
    <li> <b>Name</b>: David Zureick-Brown
    <li> <b>Affiliation</b>: Amherst College
    <li> <b>Department</b>: Mathematics and Statistics
