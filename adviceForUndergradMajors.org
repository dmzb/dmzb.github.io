* Advice for major advisees
** General advice.
 - Take as many of the 100 and 200 level classes as you can, as early as you can.
 - Take 250 (Foundations of math) as soon as possible
** Once you have taken 250
 - If you took 250 in the fall, take 321 (Vector Spaces)
 - If you took 250 in the Spring and are doing a 
   - pure math BS
     - take 318 (Complex Analysis)
     - take some non-empty subset of 421 (Abstract algebra) and 411 (Real Analysis). 
     - if you're a strong student take all three
   - Applied BS
     - I have less advice. Still good to take some subset of 
       - 315 (Numerical Analysis)
       - 351 (Partial Differential Equations)
       - 361 (Probability and Statistics)
   - math BA
     - freestyle -- electives, whatever interests you. 
** If you are thinking of going to grad school in theoretical math
  - take the algebra and real analysis sequences as soon as possible. 
  - If there are any electives that you haven't taken (e.g., number theory) try to take those too.
  - The math subject GRE is very important; top 5 pure math grad schools (e.g., Berkeley) don't accept anyone under 80th percentile. 
  - To get into a good program, you need
    - a very good GPA
    - a very good math subject GRE score
    - some other things to distinguish you
      - Do an REU (or two); list [[http://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/list_result.cfm%3Funitid%3D5044][here]]. (Grad programs favor people with REU's over internships.)
      - NSA summer program
      - CCR summer program
      - Take a few graduate level courses. (This is also a good indicator of whether you will enjoy doing a phd)
      - There is also an option of doing a MS/BS; basically your senior year you will take a few grad courses and write a mini thesis. (Getting into the MS/BS program requires both a good record and recommendations from your professors. Basically they need to convince the committee that you can handle grad courses and write a decent thesis.)
      - think about studying abroad (BSM, Math in Moscow)
      - get a double digit score on the Putnam. Be active in the Putnam preparation group
      - do well on the Mathematical Modeling competition
      - take an independent study in some topic outside of the core curriculum
    - In the meantime, I'm collecting links for undergraduates interested in theoretical math; check them out [[http://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/list_result.cfm?unitid=5044][here]].
