\begin{problem}{1}
Suppose that $n$ is an even integer, and let $m$ be any integer. Prove that $nm$ is even. 
\end{problem}
 
\begin{proof}
Delete this and put your solution here.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{2}
Suppose that $n$ is an odd integer. Prove that $n^2$ is an odd integer. (Hint: an integer $n$ is odd if and only if there exists an integer $k$ such that $n = 2k+1$.)
\end{problem}
 
\begin{proof}
Delete this and put your solution here.
\end{proof}
 
\begin{problem}{3}
Prove that if $n^2$ is even, then $n$ is even. (Hint: see Section 1.4)

\item All triangles are isosceles. 
\item Every door in the building was locked.
\item Some even numbers are multiples of three.
\item Every real number is less than 100.
\item Every integer is positive or negative.
\item If $f$ is a polynomial function, then $f$ is continuous at $0$.
\item If $x^2 > 0$, then $x > 0$.
\item There exists a $y \in \mathbf{R}$ such that $xy = 1$.
\item $(2 > 1)$ and $(\forall x, x^2 > 0)$
\item $\forall \epsilon > 0$, $\exists \delta > 0$ such that if $|x| < \delta$, then $|f(x)| < \epsilon$.
\end{enumerate}
