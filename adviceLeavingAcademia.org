I only have personal experience with the following career trajectory: Math BS --> Math Ph.D. --> Research Postdoc --> Research Faculty. 
<p>

This advice page is for students pursuing a Ph.D. in pure mathematics who are interested in their trajectory looking more like 

  <ul>
    <li> Math Ph.D. --> Teaching Faculty
    <li> Math Ph.D. --> Government of industry job.
</ul>


** Teaching Faculty. (Todo).

** Jobs in government of industry.

Since I have no personal experience in this, I contacted a dozen people I know who were on an academic trajectory and switched to a government or industry job.

Examples of jobs:
